Description

   While at the very beginning , I selected the geckodriver and firefox broswer to test the E-commerce website, but

it always encountered some error over and over again. I consulted some of my classmates who ran successfully, they told

me that maybe because the version of the browser was out of date.

   So I decided to use the Chrome broswer for testing the website and the driver was using the corresponding one, namely 
   
chromedriver.Initially, I also failed, I searched the reason on stackoverflow, and got the solution that the jdk should be 

used version 1.8. Also we need to set the appropriate waiting time for the broswer to load. Then I ran the test 

successfully, there were 3 storys in total, and each of the story contained 3 scenarios.

   When I try to log in with those credentials,
   Then I should recieve an Error info.

   Then it will prompt Error info again.


   The second story was checkout module.
